      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Keerthi. I’m a curious and ambitious CSE student with a deep passion for both software and aviation. My fascination with planes is something that’s always stayed with me, and it inspires me to learn more about the world of aviation. I’m also passionate about robotics and space, which made me a software intern at the Mars club. While learning Java, Python, and web development, I want to code with the goal of solving real-world problems and contribute to causes that can create positive change.</p>
